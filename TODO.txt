1. Update scripts/base/*.lua to the new system. Can avoid item-copy for now. #Hold off until reaction-trigger can keep track of items.
2. Finish classes scripts
 a. Make example spells.txt
 b. Update classes.txt
 c. Seperate out read-file, establish-class, requirements-class, and requirements-spell #DONE
 d. Finish scripts/classes/change-class.lua #DONE
 e. Create scripts/classes/learn-spell.lua #DONE
 f. Tie it all together with scripts/base/classes.lua #DONE
 g. Finish python script classes_setup.py #DONE
3. Double check wrapper.lua
 a. Make sure scripts/wrapper.lua is set up correctly
 b. Make sure scripts/lua/wrapper/*.lua are all set up correctly
4. Verify all scripts/item/*.lua are set up correctly
5. Verify all scripts/unit/*.lua are set up correctly
6. Rename special-*.lua scripts. Think of better organization.
7. Check scripts/tile/change.lua, see if there are other tile based scripts that can be done.
8. Think about making custom utility plugin for things like split (and any other scripts that are called repeatidly)
